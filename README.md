# spring-boot-api

The repository contains three different directories:
* The argocd directory contains manifests that configure clusters.
* The config directory contains manifest files with configurations for the Helm chart.
* The helm-chart directory contains the chart.

## Requirements
The project assumes that we have a configured cluster with ArgoCD installed.
